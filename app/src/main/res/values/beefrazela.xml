        <u> INGREDIENTS</u>

\n 1. ½ teaspoon coriander
\n 2. ½ teaspoon cumin
\n 3. 3 lbs beef
\n 4. 1 cup onion, sliced
\n 5. 1 teaspoon ginger paste
\n 6. 1 teaspoon garlic paste
\n 7. ¼ teaspoon coriander powder
\n 8. ¼ teaspoon cumin powder
\n 9. ⅔ teaspoon garam masala
\n10. 2-3 red chilli
\n11. 1-2 bay leaves
\n12. ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
\n13.  ½ cup oil
\n14. 3 tablespoons yogurt
\n15. salt, according to taste
        \n <u>INSTRUCTIONS</u>
\n 1.	Dry roast the whole coriander, cumin and grind. Set aside.
\n 2.	In a heavy-bottomed pan add all the other ingredients.
\n 3.	Cover the pan and cook in medium heat till the water from the beef almost dries up, stirring occasionally.
\n 4.	Once the beef is cooked and tender, add the dry roasted powdered spices.
\n 5.	Stir for 8-10 minutes adding ¾ cup of water in stages.
\n 6.	Turn off stove once gravy boils and thickens.
        \n <u>NOTES</u>
      \n Beef releases a lot of water while cooking, so if there is a lot of gravy and the beef is tender, you may not need the additional water.
        If beef is not cooked and water dries up, you may need to add more water.
