After 5 min check and add little bit water and cook on low flame. The meat will release water and will cook in it's own water. So you need to keep the flame low and lid must be on. Check every 30 minutes, if water is drying out add hot water as needed and continue cooking. When the meat is almost done add the dried red chilies and sugar, cook another 15-20 minutes on low flame. Now ready to serve with hot rice, polaw, parta, chapati etc."
