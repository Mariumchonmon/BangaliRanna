        <u>  PANTA INGREDIENTS:</u>\N
\n•	2 cups rice
\n•	Water
   \n INSTRUCTIONS
\n1.	Cook rice in normal way.
\n2.	Cool rice completely.
\n3.	Add water to submerge cooked rice. Set aside overnight.
   \n NOTES
     \n  I found it hard to get the fermented rice taste as the original panta, which is mainly due the kind of rice available in the US.
          Leftover rice works best for panta.

\n•	½ teaspoon red chili powder
\n•	½ teaspoon tarmeric

     \n  INSTRUCTIONS
\n1.	 Clean fish pieces.
\n2.	Rub chili powder, turmeric and salt generously on the fish pieces.

\n4.	Fry until golden and crispy.
 \n  NOTES
