        <u>NOTES</u>
\n      This is the most original way of Bangladeshi alu bhorta. Onion can be sautéed in a pan until translucent and golden, if you cannot
        stand raw potato. This gives a bit different but delicious alu bhorta as well. Adjust chili and garlic according to taste.
        You can also microwave the potato for 6-8 minutes instead of boiling.
